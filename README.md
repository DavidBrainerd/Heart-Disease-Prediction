# Heart-Disease-Classification-Problem
This project looks into using various python based machine learning and data science in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes. 
The original dataset came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find the dataset using this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease
